# Claudia 👩‍💻 @Mangamaui 

Hi there 👋! I am Claudia, community founder at [women.code(be)](http://bit.ly/wdcb-website) 🧡, a community for womxn who code in Belgium. With this community we hope to make a positive impact on the Belgian tech scene and culture as well as creating a safe space for fellow womxn.

At heart, I'm definitely a (tech) generalist; The last decade I gained experience working as a front-end developer, technical product manager and designer. 
Nowadays, I love to spend most of my time at women.code(be), something I am truly grateful for. 💖 Because, besides being able to help others, the community gives me the freedom to switch between so many different roles and tasks. (What more can be sattisfying for a generalist, right? 😉) 

## To give you an idea of what I do at women.code(be):
- Organising events
- Interviewing members for our monthly spotlight interviews
- Composing the monthly newsletter
- Maintaining our website
- Day-to-day operations
...


## In short:
